# The Secret Of Daisuke

I created this game for Unity's 2020 Create With Code Game Jam.

## Story

The lord of clan Takeda, Lord Daisuke lived in a castle just near this area. Legend has it that one day demons of the forest besieged his castle and slaughtered his family. Daisuke fled and hid what was left of his belongings on his way out. It is your destiny to search this forest and find his secret treasure.

## GamePlay
You start the game controlling a ball with WASD for movement, Space for jumping And shift for boost. There are clues around the map that lead you to the treasures. Your first clue is your map (Press M). After finding the locations of the treasures you can search for them if you are at their location by holding down E and staying in the location or hitting an object.
